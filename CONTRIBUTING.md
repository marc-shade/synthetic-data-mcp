# Contributing to Synthetic Data MCP

We welcome contributions from the community! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Synthetic Data MCP server.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Git
- Basic understanding of synthetic data and privacy concepts

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marc-shade/synthetic-data-mcp.git
   cd synthetic-data-mcp
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev,healthcare,finance]"
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking

Run all checks:
```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Run linting
flake8 src tests

# Type checking
mypy src
```

### Testing

We maintain high test coverage (>80%). Run tests with:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=synthetic_data_mcp --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m compliance     # Compliance tests
pytest -m privacy        # Privacy tests
pytest -m integration    # Integration tests
```
