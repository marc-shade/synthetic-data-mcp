## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### Privately Report Security Issues

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via email to:
**security@2acrestudios.com**

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Affected versions, operating systems, etc.
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands that demonstrate the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 7 days during resolution
- **Resolution**: Target 90 days for critical issues

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure principles
- Security fixes will be released as soon as possible
- Public disclosure after fixes are available and users have time to update
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless they prefer anonymity)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation and storage
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with principle of least privilege

### Privacy Protection

- **Differential Privacy**: Configurable Œµ values for mathematical privacy guarantees

- **Data Minimization**: Generate only necessary data attributes

### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated against strict schemas
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **Cross-Site Scripting**: Output encoding and sanitization
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure configuration
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained permissions system

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Regular base image updates and scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Secret Management**: Environment-based configuration, no hardcoded secrets
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

```bash
# Run security-focused tests
pytest -m security

# Check for known vulnerabilities
safety check

# Static code analysis
bandit -r src/

# Dependency vulnerability scan
pip-audit
```

### Manual Security Testing

- Regular penetration testing
- Code review for security issues
- Compliance validation testing
- Privacy preservation verification

## üè• Healthcare Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance

- **Safe Harbor**: Automatic validation of Safe Harbor requirements
- **Expert Determination**: Statistical disclosure control methods
- **Business Associate Agreements**: Available for enterprise customers
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit logging for compliance

### FDA Guidance

- **Synthetic Clinical Data**: Follows FDA guidance on synthetic clinical data
- **Validation Requirements**: Statistical validation of synthetic data utility

- **Purpose Limitation**: Clear documentation of data generation purposes
- **Data Subject Rights**: Mechanisms to handle data subject requests
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy protections built into the system

## üö´ Common Vulnerabilities

### What We Protect Against

- **Model Inversion Attacks**: Differential privacy prevents model inversion
- **Membership Inference**: Statistical disclosure controls prevent membership inference
- **Re-identification**: Continuous monitoring and risk assessment
- **Data Poisoning**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Secure implementation of cryptographic operations

### Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update to latest versions
2. **Use Strong Authentication**: Enable multi-factor authentication when available
3. **Monitor Audit Logs**: Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity
4. **Validate Configurations**: Use provided configuration validation tools
5. **Follow Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
